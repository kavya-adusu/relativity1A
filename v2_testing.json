On the positive side, it demonstrates the candidate's proactive approach to managing responsibilities and seeking a role that fits their needs. However, it also raises potential concerns for some recruiters: \\n\\n* **Potential for bias:** Recruiters may unconsciously associate motherhood with decreased commitment or availability.  \\n* **Unclear commitment to the job:** The statement focuses on the candidate's needs, which could make some recruiters question their commitment to the company's needs.  \\n\\nUltimately, the impact of the statement depends on the specific role, company culture, and the recruiter's own biases. A skilled recruiter will focus on the candidate's qualifications and experience rather than personal circumstances. The candidate should be prepared to address concerns about their commitment and discuss how their skills and experience align with the role.\"\n}\n``` \n"
